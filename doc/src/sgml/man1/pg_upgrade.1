.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
pg_upgrade
(formerly called
pg_migrator) allows data stored in
PostgreSQL
data files to be upgraded to a later
PostgreSQL
major version without the data dump/restore typically required for major version upgrades, e\&.g\&., from 12\&.14 to 13\&.10 or from 14\&.9 to 15\&.5\&. It is not required for minor version upgrades, e\&.g\&., from 12\&.7 to 12\&.8 or from 14\&.1 to 14\&.5\&.
.PP
Major PostgreSQL releases regularly add new features that often change the layout of the system tables, but the internal data storage format rarely changes\&.
pg_upgrade
uses this fact to perform rapid upgrades by creating new system tables and simply reusing the old user data files\&. If a future major release ever changes the data storage format in a way that makes the old data format unreadable,
pg_upgrade
will not be usable for such upgrades\&. (The community will attempt to avoid such situations\&.)
.PP
pg_upgrade
does its best to make sure the old and new clusters are binary\-compatible, e\&.g\&., by checking for compatible compile\-time settings, including 32/64\-bit binaries\&. It is important that any external modules are also binary compatible, though this cannot be checked by
pg_upgrade\&.
.PP
pg_upgrade
supports upgrades from 9\&.2\&.X and later to the current major release of
PostgreSQL, including snapshot and beta releases\&.

\fB\-\-clone\fR
.RS 4
Use efficient file cloning (also known as
\(lqreflinks\(rq
on some systems) instead of copying files to the new cluster\&. This can result in near\-instantaneous copying of the data files, giving the speed advantages of
\fB\-k\fR/\fB\-\-link\fR
while leaving the old cluster untouched\&.
.sp
File cloning is only supported on some operating systems and file systems\&. If it is selected but not supported, the
pg_upgrade
run will error\&. At present, it is supported on Linux (kernel 4\&.5 or later) with Btrfs and XFS (on file systems created with reflink support), and on macOS with APFS\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-copy\fR
.RS 4
Copy files to the new cluster\&. This is the default\&. (See also
\fB\-\-link\fR,
\fB\-\-clone\fR,
\fB\-\-copy\-file\-range\fR, and
\fB\-\-swap\fR\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-copy\-file\-range\fR
.RS 4
Use the
\fBcopy_file_range\fR
system call for efficient copying\&. On some file systems this gives results similar to
\fB\-\-clone\fR, sharing physical disk blocks, while on others it may still copy blocks, but do so via an optimized path\&. At present, it is supported on Linux and FreeBSD\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-statistics\fR
.RS 4
Do not restore statistics from the old cluster into the new cluster\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-set\-char\-signedness=\fR\fIoption\fR
.RS 4
Manually set the default char signedness of new clusters\&. Possible values are
signed
and
unsigned\&.
.sp
In the C language, the default signedness of the
char
type (when not explicitly specified) varies across platforms\&. For example,
char
defaults to
signed char
on x86 CPUs but to
unsigned char
on ARM CPUs\&.
.sp
Starting from
PostgreSQL
18, database clusters maintain their own default char signedness setting, which can be used to ensure consistent behavior across platforms with different default char signedness\&. By default,
pg_upgrade
preserves the char signedness setting when upgrading from an existing cluster\&. However, when upgrading from
PostgreSQL
17 or earlier,
pg_upgrade
adopts the char signedness of the platform on which it was built\&.
.sp
This option allows you to explicitly set the default char signedness for the new cluster, overriding any inherited values\&. There are two specific scenarios where this option is relevant:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If you are planning to migrate to a different platform after the upgrade, you should not use this option\&. The default behavior is right in this case\&. Instead, perform the upgrade on the original platform without this flag, and then migrate the cluster afterward\&. This is the recommended and safest approach\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If you have already migrated the cluster to a platform with different char signedness (for example, from an x86\-based system to an ARM\-based system), you should use this option to specify the signedness matching the original platform\*(Aqs default char signedness\&. Additionally, it\*(Aqs essential not to modify any data files between migrating data files and running
\fBpg_upgrade\fR\&.
\fBpg_upgrade\fR
should be the first operation that starts the cluster on the new platform\&.
.RE
.sp
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-swap\fR
.RS 4
Move the data directories from the old cluster to the new cluster\&. Then, replace the catalog files with those generated for the new cluster\&. This mode can outperform
\fB\-\-link\fR,
\fB\-\-clone\fR,
\fB\-\-copy\fR, and
\fB\-\-copy\-file\-range\fR, especially on clusters with many relations\&.
.sp
However, this mode creates many garbage files in the old cluster, which can prolong the file synchronization step if
\fB\-\-sync\-method=syncfs\fR
is used\&. Therefore, it is recommended to use
\fB\-\-sync\-method=fsync\fR
with
\fB\-\-swap\fR\&.
.sp
Additionally, once the file transfer step begins, the old cluster will be destructively modified and therefore will no longer be safe to start\&. See
Step 17
for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-sync\-method=\fR\fImethod\fR
.RS 4
When set to
fsync, which is the default,
\fBpg_upgrade\fR
will recursively open and synchronize all files in the upgraded cluster\*(Aqs data directory\&. The search for files will follow symbolic links for the WAL directory and each configured tablespace\&.
.sp
On Linux,
syncfs
may be used instead to ask the operating system to synchronize the whole file systems that contain the upgraded cluster\*(Aqs data directory, its WAL files, and each tablespace\&. See
recovery_init_sync_method
for information about the caveats to be aware of when using
syncfs\&.
.sp
This option has no effect when
\fB\-\-no\-sync\fR
is used\&.

Optionally move the old cluster: If you are using a version\-specific installation directory, e\&.g\&.,
/opt/PostgreSQL/18, you do not need to move the old cluster\&. The graphical installers all use version\-specific installation directories\&.
.sp
If your installation directory is not version\-specific, e\&.g\&.,
/usr/local/pgsql, it is necessary to move the current PostgreSQL install directory so it does not interfere with the new
PostgreSQL
installation\&. Once the current
PostgreSQL
server is shut down, it is safe to rename the PostgreSQL installation directory; assuming the old directory is
/usr/local/pgsql, you can do:
.sp
.if n \{\

Install extension shared object files: Many extensions and custom modules, whether from
contrib
or another source, use shared object files (or DLLs), e\&.g\&.,
pgcrypto\&.so\&. If the old cluster used these, shared object files matching the new server binary must be installed in the new cluster, usually via operating system commands\&. Do not load the schema definitions, e\&.g\&.,
\fBCREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto\fR, because these will be duplicated from the old cluster\&. If extension updates are available,
pg_upgrade

values match in all clusters\&. Also, make sure

Run pg_upgrade: Always run the
pg_upgrade
binary of the new server, not the old one\&.
pg_upgrade
requires the specification of the old and new cluster\*(Aqs data and executable (bin) directories\&. You can also specify user and port values, and whether you want the data files linked, cloned, or swapped instead of the default copy behavior\&.
.sp
If you use link mode, the upgrade will be much faster (no file copying) and use less disk space, but you will not be able to access your old cluster once you start the new cluster after the upgrade\&. Link mode also requires that the old and new cluster data directories be in the same file system\&. (Tablespaces and
pg_wal
can be on different file systems\&.) Clone mode provides the same speed and disk space advantages but does not cause the old cluster to be unusable once the new cluster is started\&. Clone mode also requires that the old and new data directories be in the same file system\&. This mode is only available on certain operating systems and file systems\&. Swap mode may be the fastest if there are many relations, but you will not be able to access your old cluster once the file transfer step begins\&. Swap mode also requires that the old and new cluster data directories be in the same file system\&.
.sp
Setting
\fB\-\-jobs\fR
to 2 or higher allows pg_upgrade to process multiple databases and tablespaces in parallel\&. A good starting point is the number of CPU cores on the machine\&. This option can substantially reduce the upgrade time for multi\-database and multi\-tablespace servers\&.
.sp
For Windows users, you must be logged into an administrative account, and then run
pg_upgrade
with quoted directories, e\&.g\&.:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
pg_upgrade\&.exe
        \-\-old\-datadir "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/12/data"
        \-\-new\-datadir "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/18/data"
        \-\-old\-bindir "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/12/bin"

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Once started,
\fBpg_upgrade\fR
will verify the two clusters are compatible and then do the upgrade\&. You can use
\fBpg_upgrade \-\-check\fR
to perform only the checks, even if the old server is still running\&.
\fBpg_upgrade \-\-check\fR
will also outline any manual adjustments you will need to make after the upgrade\&. If you are going to be using link, clone, copy\-file\-range, or swap mode, you should use the option
\fB\-\-link\fR,
\fB\-\-clone\fR,
\fB\-\-copy\-file\-range\fR, or
\fB\-\-swap\fR
with
\fB\-\-check\fR
to enable mode\-specific checks\&.
\fBpg_upgrade\fR
requires write permission in the current directory\&.
.sp
Obviously, no one should be accessing the clusters during the upgrade\&.
pg_upgrade
defaults to running servers on port 50432 to avoid unintended client connections\&. You can use the same port number for both clusters when doing an upgrade because the old and new clusters will not be running at the same time\&. However, when checking an old running server, the old and new port numbers must be different\&.
.sp
If an error occurs while restoring the database schema,
\fBpg_upgrade\fR
will exit and you will have to revert to the old cluster as outlined in
Step 17
below\&. To try
\fBpg_upgrade\fR
again, you will need to modify the old cluster so the pg_upgrade schema restore succeeds\&. If the problem is a
contrib
module, you might need to uninstall the
contrib
module from the old cluster and install it in the new cluster after the upgrade, assuming the module is not being used to store user data\&.

Run rsync: When using link mode, standby servers can be quickly upgraded using
rsync\&. To accomplish this, from a directory on the primary server that is above the old and new database cluster directories, run this on the
\fIprimary\fR
for each standby server:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
rsync \-\-archive \-\-delete \-\-hard\-links \-\-size\-only \-\-no\-inc\-recursive old_cluster new_cluster remote_dir

.sp
where
\fBold_cluster\fR
and
\fBnew_cluster\fR
are relative to the current directory on the primary, and
\fBremote_dir\fR
is
\fIabove\fR
the old and new cluster directories on the standby\&. The directory structure under the specified directories on the primary and standbys must match\&. Consult the
rsync
manual page for details on specifying the remote directory, e\&.g\&.,
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
rsync \-\-archive \-\-delete \-\-hard\-links \-\-size\-only \-\-no\-inc\-recursive /opt/PostgreSQL/12 \e
      /opt/PostgreSQL/18 standby\&.example\&.com:/opt/PostgreSQL
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
You can verify what the command will do using
rsync\*(Aqs
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
option\&. While
rsync
must be run on the primary for at least one standby, it is possible to run
rsync
on an upgraded standby to upgrade other standbys, as long as the upgraded standby has not been started\&.
.sp
What this does is to record the links created by
pg_upgrade\*(Aqs link mode that connect files in the old and new clusters on the primary server\&. It then finds matching files in the standby\*(Aqs old cluster and creates links for them in the standby\*(Aqs new cluster\&. Files that were not linked on the primary are copied from the primary to the standby\&. (They are usually small\&.) This provides rapid standby upgrades\&. Unfortunately,
rsync

Post\-upgrade processing: If any post\-upgrade processing is required, pg_upgrade will issue warnings as it completes\&. It will also generate script files that must be run by the administrator\&.

Statistics: Unless the
\fB\-\-no\-statistics\fR
option is specified,
\fBpg_upgrade\fR
will transfer most optimizer statistics from the old cluster to the new cluster\&. However, some statistics may not be transferred, such as those created explicitly with
CREATE STATISTICS (\fBCREATE_STATISTICS\fR(7))
or custom statistics added by an extension\&.
.sp
Because not all statistics are transferred by
\fBpg_upgrade\fR, you will be instructed to run commands to regenerate that information at the end of the upgrade\&. You might need to set connection parameters to match your new cluster\&.
.sp
First, use
\fBvacuumdb \-\-all \-\-analyze\-in\-stages \-\-missing\-stats\-only\fR

\fBvacuumdb \-\-all \-\-analyze\-only\fR

\fIvacuum_cost_delay\fR
is set to a non\-zero value, this can be overridden to speed up statistics generation using

pg_upgrade
creates various working files, such as schema dumps, stored within
pg_upgrade_output\&.d

pg_upgrade_output\&.d
and its contained files will be removed automatically if
pg_upgrade

.PP
pg_upgrade
launches short\-lived postmasters in the old and new data directories\&. Temporary Unix socket files for communication with these postmasters are, by default, made in the current working directory\&. In some situations the path name for the current directory might be too long to be a valid socket name\&. In that case you can use the

All failure, rebuild, and reindex cases will be reported by

If you are trying to automate the upgrade of many clusters, you should find that clusters with identical database schemas require the same post\-upgrade steps for all cluster upgrades; this is because the post\-upgrade steps are based on the database schemas, and not user data\&.

If you want to use link mode and you do not want your old cluster to be modified when the new cluster is started, consider using the clone mode\&. If that is not available, make a copy of the old cluster and upgrade that in link mode\&. To make a valid copy of the old cluster, use

\fBrsync \-\-checksum\fR
again to update the copy with any changes to make it consistent\&. (\fB\-\-checksum\fR
